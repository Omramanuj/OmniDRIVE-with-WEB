# Web-Controlled 4-Wheel Omnidirectional Drive Project

## Overview: 
  This project aims to create a web-controlled 4-wheel omnidirectional drive using Mecanum wheels , allowing for smooth multidirectional mobility even in confined spaces using web server.

## Introduction:
  An Omni-drive, or holonomic drive, enables movement in any direction without changing its orientation. Web-controlled omni-drives find applications in robotics, industrial automation, entertainment, and education. They consist of an ESP32, L293D motor driver, mecanum wheels, and sensors. Users can control the device remotely through a web interface, specifying direction and speed.

## Features
List the key features of your project, such as:

1. Web-based control interface  
2. Multi-directional mobility using Mecanum wheels   
3. Smooth movement in tight spaces
